There are different ways to join our activities.

### PhD fellowship

The PhD program in [Physics and Chemistry of Biological Systems](https://www.sissa.it/sbp/) at [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it)
offers regular 4-years fully funded PhD positions. Entrance exams are typically in spring and early fall, but the
exact schedule is subject to changes. Once you are selected for this PhD program, you will have the opportunity to follow
approximately 9 months of lectures and then join the group of one of the principal investigators, including ours.
For openings, follow us on [X](https://x.com/bussilab) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bussilab.bsky.social).

### Post-doctoral fellowship

We are happy to support you if you wish to apply for external funds.
So far, we managed to host two MSCA and one EMBO fellowships.
For openings, follow us on [X](https://x.com/bussilab) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bussilab.bsky.social).

### Undergraduate

We are involved in the Master in [Physics of Complex Systems](http://www.pcs.polito.it/educational_tracks/international_track)
and we can host internships. Please get in touch in due time.
