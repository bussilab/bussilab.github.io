# Biorxiv preprints must be added to this list using something like:
# - biorxiv: "10.1101/2022.07.02.498583"

# Arxiv IDs are directly searched from arXiv. If they are not
# found, they can be added here using something like:
# - arxiv: "2507.14413"

# Handles are directly searched from IRIS. If they are not
# found, they can be added here using something like:
# - handle: "20.500.11767/140550"

# Important: to avoid duplications, it is crucial that
# IRIS records contain also the preprint URL in one of the URL
# fields.

# Corrections to exisiting IRIS records must be added here
# this is to fix the page number in Amaro et al, Nature Methods (2025)
